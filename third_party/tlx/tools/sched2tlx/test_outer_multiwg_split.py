"""Multi-WG OUTER loop bodies lower correctly.

The fixture is case2 (persistent GEMM) with its outer epilogue store split
into its own warp group — the exact shape that historically made the emitter
silently drop the store while still emitting its barrier declarations.
The split WG must get its own async task, and the cvt→store hand-off must
travel through a synthesized SMEM channel with outer-iteration phases:
producer waits empty / stores / fences / arrives full; the store task waits
full, TMA-stores straight from the channel buffer, drains, arrives empty.

GPU-validated 2026-07-09 on B200: correctness rel=0.0 on four shapes, perf
identical to the single-WG emission (1.00/0.88/0.91/0.97x of handwritten).
This test pins the emission protocol without needing a GPU.
