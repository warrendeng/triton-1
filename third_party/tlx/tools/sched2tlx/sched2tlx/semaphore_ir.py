    `cross_wg_barriers` capture only CROSS-WG edges, and the sibling
    `_derive_intrawg_async_consumers` covers async-TMA SMEM buffers. This closes
    the remaining hole: an async result (a `tc_gen5_mma` accumulator or a
    `tmem_copy`) read by ANY consumer in the same warp group — a `tmem_load`, or
    another `tc_gen5_mma` reading it as an operand. Without a barrier the
    consumer races the still-in-flight async producer (tcgen05 writes TMEM
    asynchronously; the reader must gate on completion). The canonical case is
    FA-bwd's `dpT = V@dOᵀ` MMA → `dsT = pT*(dpT-Di)` read, both in `wg1`.

    Handshake mirrors the cross-WG named semaphore, intra-WG: one signal-only
    (bufferless) semaphore per (producer, consumer) pair — the producer arrives
    its `_full` via mBarriers on HW completion, the consumer waits it. No
    empty/recycle side is needed: producer and consumer share a warp group
    (sequential issue) and the consumer carries its own tcgen05 completion wait,
    so the next iteration's producer is only issued after this read completes.

    Generality note: this covers every async-result → same-WG in-loop consumer
    edge. In the current generated set only the MMA-acc → `tmem_load` shape
    occurs (case4); MMA→MMA and `tmem_copy` consumers are structurally handled
