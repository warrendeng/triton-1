"""Tombstone for the retired inherit-in-place FA4 backend.

The old functions returned a successful binding after dropping exact cycles,
physical warp placement, issue order, and solved geometry.  That behavior was
not schedule compilation.  Use
``skc.compiler.prepare_manual_cuda_handoff`` to emit the paper's pipelined,
warp-annotated IR for an expert CUDA C++ implementation.
